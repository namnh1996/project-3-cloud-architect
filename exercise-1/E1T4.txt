Based on the architecture diagram, and the steps you have taken so far to upload data and access the application web service, identify at least 2 obvious poor practices as it relates to security.  Include justification.

# Poor practice 1:
- The Web Service Instance is located in a public subnet, the WebAppSG of this instance allows ingress traffic to multiple ports(22, 5000, 80) and allows all egress traffic. Attackers have chance to attack this instance directly from the internet using its public IP address.
- Instead, this instance should be in a private subnet and only allow access from AppLoadBalancerSG to reduce the risk of "internet facing" attack.

# Poor practice 2:
- The InstanceRole has full access to any S3 bucket. Attackers can use this role to access and modify any content of any S3 bucket.
- This Role should have least permissions that enough to access S3 bucket resources.
